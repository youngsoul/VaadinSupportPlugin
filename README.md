Grails Plugin with Vaadin Support Classes

In working with Grails and learning Vaadin, I started to take some of the Vaadin constructs and make them a little more Groovy and make some of the things I was trying to do easier from a Groovy perspective and integrate that into a Grails application.

Since I am not a Vaadin expert, there might well be better ways of handling these items in a Grails application and if so I would love to hear your feedback.

This plugin assumes your primary application will have the actual Vaadin plugin installed.  All of the support classes can be found in the src/groovy directory struture.
